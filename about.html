          My path into UX/UI began at a small startup, where I transitioned from data analytics and marketing into product design. I learned to conduct user research, created workflows and designs that helped define a new MVP product, and established a collaborative design system. 
          Since then, I’ve worked with clients on UX projects varying from web, app, to branding experiences.

          Drawing in skillsets from my prior background in communication design and data analysis, I bring a data-driven perspective into my design projects. I am always curious about why people make the decisions they do, and I find it exciting to design functional, thoughtful solutions that better serve our community.

      <h2>Additional Skills</h2>
      <p>
        As a passionate UI/UX designer, I focus on crafting intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces that enhance user experiences across digital platforms. Therefore, I’ve had the opportunity to explore more than one branch of design and built up a series of additional skills that I am now able to bring with me in a UX/UI role:

        <li>Brand design</li>
        <li>Illustration</li>
