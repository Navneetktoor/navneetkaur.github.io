                    In the Phonix app, the wireframes were designed to ensure a user-friendly and intuitive experience for individuals working on their speech improvement. Each screen was carefully structured to balance functionality with simplicity, offering easy navigation across the app's core features. The wireframes include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Home Screen:</strong> Displays personalized progress, quick access to speech challenges, and a user dashboard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Speech Tracking Screen:</strong> Provides real-time feedback on users’ speech with visual cues for improvement areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Challenge Screen:</strong> Showcases interactive, gamified exercises that users can complete to enhance their speech.</li>
                        <li><strong>Learning Chapter Screen:</strong> Organized into levels, each chapter allows users to learn and practice before attempting challenges.</li>
                        <li><strong>Profile & Settings:</strong> Enables users to customize their experience, set goals, and monitor progress through detailed analytics.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Wireframe</h2>
                <p>
                    A wireframe is a blueprint or skeletal outline of an app that illustrates the structure and layout of the user interface without focusing on visual design elements like colors or typography. In the Phonix app, the wireframes serve as a critical step in the design process, helping to plan the placement of features, navigation flow, and user interactions. They ensure that the app is intuitive and easy to use, while effectively organizing the app’s key functions—such as speech tracking, learning modules, and challenges—before moving to more detailed visual design.
                    By using wireframes, we were able to focus on functionality and user experience early in the design process, ensuring that every element is placed purposefully to enhance the app’s usability.
