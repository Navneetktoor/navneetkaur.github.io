                <p>
                    SweetQueue's wireframes were the initial blueprint for the app's structure and layout. The wireframes highlighted the positioning of key features such as the order management dashboard, customer profiles, and order customization screens. Each section was designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. This foundation allowed us to map out the user experience, ensuring that bakery staff could efficiently access and manage orders, track special requests, and retrieve customer data without overwhelming visual elements.
